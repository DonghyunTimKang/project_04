<h4>Lesson 1</h4>
We'll be taking a look at four different chords today.
You'll also be learning how to read chord charts which will allow you start learning other songs that people post here or your other friendly guitar chord site.
<hr>
</br>
The first one we'll be taking a look at is the D chord
</br>

</br>
The first row of boxes you see is the first fret.
The six vertical lines you see are then strings of the guitar.
The strings are usually numbered right to left, so the line at the very right will be called string one.
The numbers you see are where your fingers should be.
Now this isn't set for all guitar players as we'll see in the next chord, but go ahead and practice that and get comfortable.
</br>

</br>
Now here we have the A chord.
We can see here it's asking us to use our index finger to hit string two, three, and four.
It's much easier to hit this when your second and third finger are on string three and two respectively.
Do some experimenting, you might think just one index finger is easier.
</br>

</br>
This will probably be the hardest chord to learn out of all of them.
This one is called the B Minor chord.
The B minor chord asks us to stretch our index finger across the second fret of the guitar and place the rest of our fingers on different strings.
My recommendation for this particular chord is to practice getting your index finger across the second fret first.
After getting the hang of that, practice placing each finger one at a time on the strings according to the chart.

</br>
Awesome job for getting this far! Are your fingers bleeding yet? Don't worry we're almost home.
This last chord is called the G chord. This will test your dexterity of your third and fourth finger.
Start with the second and third finger first, then start working your way towards getting that fourth finger on the first string.
<hr>
Now that we've learned those four chords, try strumming them one after each other. You might start to recognize the chords when they're played in succession.
If you can't play them fast enough, don't worry about it. Jimi Hendrix wasn't a guitar god after one night. Practice makes perfect. Just don't end up like this guy.
